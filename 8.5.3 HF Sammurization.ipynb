Repeatedly arrested, he underwent several internal exiles.

Serving in the Russian Civil War before overseeing the Soviet Union's establishment in 1922, Stalin assumed leadership over the country following Lenin's death in 1924. Under Stalin, socialism in one country became a central \n","tenet of the party's dogma. As a result of the Five-Year Plans implemented under his leadership, the country underwent agricultural collectivisation and rapid industrialisation, creating a centralised command economy. This led to severe disruptions of food production that contributed \n","to the famine of 1932–33. To eradicate accused \"enemies of the working class\", Stalin instituted the Great Purge, in which over a million were imprisoned and at least 700,000 executed between 1934 and 1939. By 1937, he had absolute control over the party and government.\n","'''\n","\n"," \n","summarizer(article_text)[0]['summary_text']"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["[{'summary_text': 'Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin (18 December 1878 – 5 March 1953) was a Georgian revolutionary and Soviet political leader.
